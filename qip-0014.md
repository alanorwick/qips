## Abstract

This QIP proposes modifications to the CREATE opcode in Quai Network to ensure shard-specific address generation, while maintaining CREATE2 functionality as is. The proposal aims to adapt Ethereum's address creation mechanism to Quai's sharded architecture.

## Motivation

Quai Network's sharded architecture requires addresses to be shard-specific. The current Ethereum-style CREATE opcode does not guarantee this, potentially leading to cross-shard conflicts and inefficiencies. This proposal seeks to address this issue while maintaining as much compatibility with Ethereum as possible.

## Specification

### CREATE Opcode Modification

1. The CREATE opcode will generate an address using the following method:
   
   a. Split the bytecode_data into two parts:
      - `hashCode`: All but the last 4 bytes of bytecode_data
      - `potentialSalt`: The last 4 bytes of bytecode_data
   
   b. Calculate the initial address:

      ```address = keccak256(([sender_address, sender_nonce, keccak256(hashCode), potentialSalt])[12:]```
   
   c. If the resulting address is valid for the current shard:
      - The full bytecode_data (including the last 4 bytes) is used as the contract bytecode
      - The `potentialSalt` is considered part of the actual bytecode
   
   d. If the resulting address is not valid for the current shard:
      - Proceed to step 2 for grinding

2. If the resulting address is not valid for the current shard:
The gas cost per iteration of bytecode modification and checking is the `KeccackGasCost` of the size of `concat(sender_address, sender_nonce, hashCodeHash, salt)`.
  
   a. Initialize a "grind nonce" to 0.
  
   b. Append 4 bytes representing the grind nonce to the original bytecode_data:
      ```
      extended_bytecode = bytecode_data + [4]byte(grind_nonce)
   ```
   c. Split the extended_bytecode:
      - `hashCode`: All but the last 4 bytes of extended_bytecode
      - `salt`: The last 4 bytes of extended_bytecode
   
   d. Generate a new address using:
      `address = keccak256([sender_address, sender_nonce, keccak256(hashCode), salt])[12:]`
   
   e. If the address is still not valid, increment the grind nonce and repeat steps b, c, and d until a valid shard-specific address is found, until 1,000 tries has been exceeded, or the gas limit has been exceed.
   d. Exceeding 1,000 tries without finding a valid shard address will result in a error, thus failing the contract deployment.

### Gas Calculation Example

To illustrate the gas cost of the grinding process, consider the following example:

Input data: `0003590fc75d4136fd78ccf325764e51df61b282000000000000000086404fb8bc0b1b2625ac08825a59fe8d28ac927c571eccb1bc2c1a57291b163e00000025`

Number of grinding attempts: 36

Gas calculation formula:
```go
func calculateKeccakGas(data []byte) int64 {
    keccakBaseGas := int64(params.Sha3Gas)  // 30
    wordCount := (len(data) + 31) / 32
    return keccakBaseGas + int64(wordCount) * int64(params.Sha3WordGas)  // Sha3WordGas = 6
}
```


In this example:
- Data length: 66 bytes
- Word count: (66 + 31) / 32 = 3 words
- Gas per Keccak operation: 30 + (3 * 6) = 48 gas

Total gas cost for grinding:
48 gas * 36 attempts = 1,728 gas

## Gas Efficiency Comparison

To illustrate the gas efficiency of our proposed CREATE opcode modification, let's compare two approaches:

1. **Proposed Grinding Process**: Hash all but the last 4 bytes of the bytecode once, then iterate with a 4-byte salt.
2. **Full Bytecode Hashing**: Hash the entire bytecode on each iteration.

### Example Scenario

- Contract Bytecode Length: 489 bytes
- Number of iterations needed: 36

### Gas Calculation Results

1. **Proposed Grinding Process**:
   - Initial bytecode hash: 126 gas
   - Each iteration: 48 gas
   - Total gas: 126 + (48 * 36) = 1,854 gas

2. **Full Bytecode Hashing**:
   - Each iteration: 126 gas
   - Total gas: 126 * 36 = 4,536 gas

### Gas Savings

By using the proposed grinding process instead of full bytecode hashing, we save:

4,536 - 1,854 = 2,682 gas

This represents a 59.13% reduction in gas costs for this scenario.

The gas savings become even more significant for larger contracts or when more iterations are required to find a valid shard-specific address. This efficiency is achieved by hashing the majority of the bytecode only once and then iterating on a small 4-byte salt, rather than repeatedly hashing the entire bytecode.

### CREATE2 Opcode

No changes are proposed for the CREATE2 opcode. It will continue to function as in Ethereum:
```
address = keccak256(0xff ++ sender_address ++ salt ++ keccak256(init_code))[12:]
```

## Rationale

### Ethereum's CREATE and CREATE2

Ethereum implemented CREATE and CREATE2 with distinct goals:

1. CREATE: Provides a simple, deterministic way to generate contract addresses based on the sender's address and nonce. This method ensures uniqueness but doesn't allow predicting future addresses easily.

2. CREATE2: Introduced to allow for deterministic address generation regardless of sender state, enabling counterfactual instantiation and other advanced patterns.

### Quai's Modifications

1. CREATE Modification: 
   - Maintains compatibility with Ethereum's CREATE for cases where the initial address is valid for the shard.
   - Introduces grinding only when necessary, minimizing divergence from Ethereum.
   - Ensures all addresses are shard-specific, maintaining Quai's sharded architecture integrity.

2. No Change to CREATE2:
   - CREATE2's deterministic nature already allows for shard-specific address generation by careful selection of the salt.
   - Maintaining CREATE2 as-is preserves compatibility with existing Ethereum patterns and contracts that rely on its behavior.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change will affect the addresses generated by CREATE in cases where grinding is necessary. Existing contracts and those deployed with CREATE2 will not be affected. However, any systems or contracts that rely on predicting future CREATE-generated addresses may need to be updated to account for the potential grinding step.

## Security Considerations

- The grinding process in CREATE may slightly increase the computational cost of contract deployment in some cases.
- Care must be taken to ensure that the grinding process does not introduce new attack vectors, such as DoS opportunities.
- The implications of this change on gas costs and block limits should be carefully considered.
- Address calculation and bytecode integrity:
  - The new address calculation method, which uses the last 4 bytes of the init code as a salt, introduces potential ambiguities and security risks:
    1. Bytecode HashCode Truncation: If a valid address is found on the first attempt, it could result in the last 4 bytes of the actual bytecode being interpreted as the salt, effectively truncating the deployed code in the hashCode.
    2. Salt Overloading: The system overloads the meaning of the last 4 bytes, using them as both potential bytecode and a salt for address grinding.
    3. Nil Salt Possibility: In cases where a valid address is found immediately, the "salt" could effectively be nil (all zeros), which might have unintended consequences for contracts expecting a non-zero salt.
    4. Bytecode Length Variability: The final deployed bytecode length could vary based on how many grinding attempts were needed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in contracts that rely on specific code lengths.
    5. Incorrect Salt Provided: A user could provide a false salt value or random data beyond the bytecode. This will lead to an additional 4 bytes appended at the end of the EVM computation.
  - Careful consideration must be given to how this address calculation method interacts with existing and future smart contract patterns, especially those that may rely on precise bytecode lengths or content.
