## Abstract ##

This QIP defines the process and protocol changes required to allow the
merge-mining of transactions.

## Motivation ##

Merge-mined transactions (MMTX) enable objective ordering of transactions in
proposed blocks, aligning incentives for block producers and miners.
Additionally, MMTX reduces the impact of miner extractable value (MEV) on users
and incentivizes hash contribution to the network.

## Specification ##

### Overview ###

MEV presents two issues: increased user costs and compromised chain progression
and security. Large MEV opportunities can outweigh block reward incentives,
leading miners to compete for MEV rather than cooperatively extending the
longest chain. Currently, cryptocurrencies use separate mechanisms for ordering blocks
and transactions within blocks. This distinction is unnecessary and creates
competing markets for the same service: transaction ordering. One unified
market for transaction ordering (for both intra and inter-block transactions)
would eliminate this competition, enhancing security and finalization speed.

To implement a hash-based ordering market, it must govern both transaction and
block ordering, removing conflicts between transaction and block progression.

### Ordering of MMTXs in a Block ###

This QIP suggests a base fee for processing, with transaction order determined
by worked ProgPow hashes. Transactions would be merge-mined with blocks,
and the mining work done on a transaction would dictate its order in a block.
The most worked transactions would be prioritized. Algorithmically, this
involves sorting ProgPow hashes within each block based on their values,
with lower hashes processed first.

#### Sorting Criteria and Algorithmic Application ####

Let $H = \{ hash_{i,j} \mid 1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq m_i \}$ be a set
of cryptographic hash values, where $n$ is the number of blocks in the chain
and $m_i$ are the transactions in the $i^{th}$ block.

Given the defined set of hashes $H$, we apply a sorting algorithm to order the hashes
within each block. Specifically, for each $i^{th}$ block, we ensure
the order of the transactions follows the criterion $hash_{i,j} <
hash_{i,j-1}$, with the lowest value of $hash_{i,j}$ being processed first in
the $i^{th}$ block.

```
Algorithm 1 Sorting Hashes within Blockchain Blocks
1: H
2: function constructor(H′)
3:   H ← H′ ▷ Set of hash values H
4: end function
5: function sortHashes(H)
6:   for each block i from 1 to n do
7:     for each transaction j from 1 to m_i do
8:       Perform insertion sort on H[i] based on the hash order:
9:       if hash_{i,j} < hash_{i,j-1} then
10:         Swap hash_{i,j} with hash_{i,j-1}
11:       end if
12:     end for
13:   end for
14: end function
```

This would mean that to MEV a MMTX, say sandwich or front-run, a MEV bot would
have to mine a transaction with appropriate order around the targeted
transaction. This may seem trivial for transactions which do not have
significant amounts of work, however, sandwiching a tx would require finding a
mined tx which is in front of and behind the target transaction. Moreover, any
MEV bot would have to execute these attacks in real-time.

## Weighting of MMTXs ##

In addition to organizing transactions based on their hash values, the protocol
incorporates the work done on each transaction into the overall entropy of the
block. This approach means that blocks containing transactions with a higher
amount of work, and therefore lower entropy, are more likely to be recognized
as the primary block in the chain. This alignment between transaction ordering
and the growth of the longest chain is essential for maintaining network
integrity.

However, this method requires careful consideration to prevent potential
exploits. If miners can mine transactions independently and include them
arbitrarily in future blocks, they could amass a large number of mined
transactions to dominate block creation. To counter this, the block's hash,
with which a transaction is merged-mined, is used as a reference point. The
contribution of a transaction's weight to a block's weight diminishes based on
the age difference between the transaction and the block. This mechanism
incentivizes miners to include transactions in their blocks as quickly as
possible.

An additional layer of complexity arises with merge-mined transactions. These
transactions can only be included if they are merged-mined with a canonical
block. By mining on top of an already existing block, the work invested in
merge-mined transactions serves to validate and reinforce the legitimacy of
that block. This process not only enhances the security of the chain through
implicit verification but also contributes to the overall chain entropy.

The decay in the contribution of a transaction's work to a block's entropy over
time is also an important factor. The further away a transaction is from the
current chain tip, the less it contributes to the block's entropy. Therefore,
it's proposed that the weight of a transaction's work should decrease by half
for each block that passes after it becomes eligible for inclusion. This
approach encourages producers of merge-mined transactions to reference the most
recent block, ensuring their transactions are included promptly. It also
motivates miners to quickly include valid merge-mined transactions in their
blocks, maximizing the total entropy and thereby strengthening the blockchain.

### Formal Definitions ###

- Let $Tx_{i,n}$ denote a MMTX, where $i$ is the block index referenced by the
MMTx, $n$ is the current block index, and $j$ is the index for each MMTx
referencing block $i$ included in block $n$.
- Define $S_{int}$ as the bits of entropy achieved from mining a block, and
$S_{target}$ as the entropy target in bits. A block is successfully mined when
the condition $S_{int} > S_{target}$ is met.

#### Transaction Entropy Computation ####

The transaction entropy for a set of transactions included in block $i$ is computed as follows:

$$ x_{tx,i,j} = log(k/hash_{tx,i,j}) $$

$$ S_{tx,i} = \sum_{l=i-m}^{i} \frac{1}{2^{l}} \times e^{-S_{int,i}} \sum_{j=0}^{q_i} \frac{x_{tx,i,j}}{e^{-x_{tx,i,j}}} $$

In this expression:

$k$ represents the field size. $q_i$ denotes the number of transactions in
block $i$, and $m$ is the depth of computation for the transactions
contributing to the block entropy.

#### Total Block Entropy ###

The total entropy of a block is given by:

$$ S_{block,i} = S_{tx,i} + S_{int,i} + S_{block,{i-1}} $$

Although, the entropy of MMTx could be calculated going all the way back to
genesis, from the view of practical computations the depth of computation, $m$,
should be limited to a practical value.  It is proposed that this could be set
to m=16. This would provide a mechanism wherein latent transactions would still
add entropy but would prevent the entropy computation from becoming
impractical.

Additionally, it should be noted that the expected maximum contribution of
transactions to the block entropy total is the square of the intrinsic
threshold. For example, if $S_{target} = 20$ then $S_{tx,i}$ could be upto
400.

## MMTX propagation incentives ##

Counting the work of transactions towards the weight of a block can have
unintended consequences. Specifically, it might motivate miners to hold back
transactions with substantial work to gain an advantage in block mining. This
could negatively impact the network since blocks containing unpropagated
transactions take longer to verify and unpropogated transaction will provide
the miner that includes it an advantage over other miners which is not
proportional to their hashrate.

This issue is partially mitigated by two factors. First, if the inclusion of
unpropagated transactions significantly delays block validation, the block is
more likely to be rejected (become an uncle block), penalizing the miner
responsible. Second, users who broadcast transactions with a substantial amount
of work are motivated to ensure rapid network propagation of their
transactions, increasing the likelihood of their inclusion in a block with high
priority.

However, if these incentives aren't enough, the marginal cost of mining an
MMTX can be changed with the demand for interblock ordering.  As long as the
marginal cost of MMTX production is not allowed to be zero, there will always
be an incentive to propogate MMTXs.

### MMTX variable cost ###

When a MMTX is constructed to allow the work to be counted for both a
transaction and a block, an issue arises due to the zero marginal cost of
reusing the hash to mine a transaction that was going to mine a block.  This is
also the origin of potential withholding attacks when mined transactions are
introduced. To eleviate these issues, it is proposed that a new merge mining
scheme is introduced which allows MMTX marginal cost of production to decrease
with increased demand for transaction ordering. Thus a new mechanism is
proposed that will change the percentage of work that can count torwards merge
mined blocks.  This will prevent a withholding incentive while also creating a
mechanism that will guarantee that the blockchain remains lively when there is
high demand for ordering. The goal is to make it so that the marginal cost of
mining a transaction is high when demand for ordering is low, and conversley
the marginal cost for mining is low when the demand for ordering is high.  It
is important to note, that the marginal cost cannot allowed to be zero else the
withholding incentives will be reintroduced.

#### Secondary threshold criteria for MMTX block ####

A secondary threshold can be used to establish a criteria for determining if a
share meets the block criteria and this criteria can be adjusted by what is in
the proposed block dynamically to ensure that the chain always remains lively.
The secondary threshold criteria will be based on the trailing zeros of the
hash.  Specifically, the criteria to become an MMTX block will be met if:

$$ TX_{hash,val} < B_{mmtx,t} $$

where $ TX_{hash,val} = TX_{hash}[end-2:] $ or more simply the last two bytes
in the hash, and the $ B_{mmtx,t} $ is the block threshold for the MMTTX to be
valid.  The block threshold $ B_{mmtx,t} $ will be adjusted such that the
threshold is high when ordering demand is low and gets lower as ordering demand
increases.  This will ensure that blocks remain lively even if there is high
instantaneous changes in demand for mined transactions.  The block threshold
will be calculated as follows:

$$ B_{mmtx, t} = t_{max} * \frac{\Delta S_{tx}}{\Delta S_{int} + \Delta S_{tx}} $$

where $t_{max} = 2^{16} - 2^{12}$ to ensure there is always a marginal cost to
an MMTX. The $B_{mmtx,t}$ threshold can be computed instantaniously and adjust
to the changes in ordering demand in real-time. NOTE: That because a MMTX
commits to a block the value of $B_{mmtx,t}$ is deterministic and cannot be
changed without changing the commitment or the work done on that commitment, ie
the workObject.

It is interesting to note the impact of the block expectation time on the
change in $B_{mmtx,t}$ with the total work included in the block. Specifically,
an empty block has the nominal expectation time.  The block time will increase
to maximum of 2 times the expectation time before it logorithmically approaches
the nominal expectation time as the block continues to fill. This will actually
allow blocks to slow down when there is a high change in demand of ordering,
but also gaurantee liveliness as the demand continues to grow.  

## WorkObject ##

The interesting implication of MMTX is the creation of a new datastructure that
will be referred to as a workedObject.  All data that may be inserted or appended
to the blockchain highest abstract form is now a workObject.  More specifically,
a MMTX must take the form of a workObject.  Depending on the weight of the
workObject, it will become either a header or a MMTX.

### Impact on Header ###

The fields that will be needed to compute a workObject's work, or entropy reduction,
need to be removed from the header so that they are not needlessly replicated.

The fields that will be removed from the header are as follows:

| Field       | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| ParentHash[2]  | common.Hash   |
| Number[2] | *big.Int |
| Nonce       | uint64        |

The following fields will be renamed:

| Old Field       | New Field          |
|-------------|---------------|
| ParentHash[]  | DomParentHash[]   |
| Number[] | DomNumber[] |

### WorkObject Structure ###

| Field       | Type          |
|-------------|---------------|
| HeaderHash  | common.Hash   |
| ParentHash  | common.Hash   |
| Number | *big.Int |
| TxHash      | common.Hash   |
| Nonce       | uint64        |

The astute reader will notice that the fields that were deleted from the header
are now included in the workObject structure. The sealHash for the workObject will
be computed by hashing all of the fields except for the Nonce.  Mining of the
workObject will take place by grinding the Nonce field. Once a workObject is found
the producer will be able to determine if it is a MMTX or a Block based on the
entropy threshold acheived. This workObject can then be combined with either the
corresponding Header or Transaction body to create either an MMTX or a block.
The MMTX must then be signed by the appropriate private key and the MMTX and
the signature can be transmitted to form a transaction. If a block is achieved,
the workObject can be combined with the header and optionally the block body to
produce a valid header or valid block and transmitted with no further
processing.

## Effect of MMTX on Adversarial Resiliance ##

In PoW systems it is shown in {Everything is a Race and Nakamoto Always Wins}
that all attacks on safety of a PoW blockchain can be simplified to a private
mining attack.  This means that in a theoretical network a PoW chain has
adversarial resiliance if $(1-\beta) > 0.5$. This is were the classical
statement about being resiliant to a %51 attack originates.  However, moving
beyond the simple analysis, accounting for the fact that the honest majority
has a disadvantage due the coordination delay, $\Delta$, it has been shown this
decreases to 33% adversarial resiliance. The interesting thing to note here is
the effect of the delay, $d_{tx,i,j}$, on the private mining attack.
Specifically, if $\max(d_{tx,i,j}) > \Delta$ the network delay can be offset by
the processing delay associated with MMTXs which a private miner will need to
produce in order to create a competitive privately mined chain greater than
length 1. Therefore, it is likely that PoEM with MMTX will create a consensus
mechanism that is resiliant to attackers that control the majority of the
hashrate.

There is however, a contravening consideration, which is the ability for late
joining clients to join the network.  Specifically, will a late joining client
or a non-nefarious network partition be able to catch up to the honest
majority?  The answer to this questions depends on the number of threads that a
node has to validate MMTXs relative to the number of MMTXs included in a block
on expectation.

For example, if a honest node has a modern GPU, it will have > 16,000 threads.
Each on of these could be used to validate the SDF of MMTXs in parallel.  Thus
if the average block has 2,000 MMTXs and the average $mean(d_{tx,i,j}) = 1/2 * Block_{time}$
a late joining client would be able to catch up to the network at
a rate $r$, which is 1/16th of clock-time in this example.  This could be
further improved by running a client with a more performant GPU or multiple
GPUs. However, the ability for a client to catch up will only be compressed by
honest nodes to a finite degree.  This means that if an attacker is running a
private chain in which they are creating and referencing MMTXs to enable the
creation of a competitive chain, they will suffer a processing delay penalty
for a fork of depth, $f$, of $d_{fork} = f*Block_{time}*\bar{r}$. This offsets
the disadvantage of the honest majority due to the coordination delay and will
incrase the adversarial resiliance of the system to > 51% if
$Block{time}*\bar{r}>\Delta$.

### Impact of MMTX on MEV ###

Lets explore what would happen here if there was a transaction that can be
exploited by being front run by a MEV bot. All MEV exploits normally require a
MEV bot to get at least 1 tx in-front of the $tx_{MEV}$ they are trying to
exploit. To front run $tx_{MEV}$ the MEV bots would have the option of mining a
transaction which has a greater workObject than tx_{MEV} or by attempting to mine
an alternate chain tip. Lets assume that there are at least 2 competing MEV
bots, Alice and Bob, which have roughly the same amount of hash power which in
total are both less than 50% of the hash rate. If Alice finds a MMTX with a
workObject greater than the mined $S_{tx,Alice} > S_{tx,MEV}$, Bob will need to
mine his transaction such that $S_{tx,Bob} > S_{tx,Alice}$. This back and forth
competition will proceed until Alice, Bob, or some other miner finds a entropy
of $S_{tx} > S_{int}$ which would lead to the mining of a new block.

Lets say that at this point in time Alice has managed to order her transaction
in front of Bobs. That means that the block will have a block entropy of at
least $S_{block} >= S_{int} + S_{tx,Alice} + S_{tx,MEV}$.

If Bob is unsatisfied with this result he can try and mine a new tip which is a
fork with the block that was just mined. Bobs expected entropy for the nth
block will be $S_{block,bob} >= S_{int} + S_{tx,bob} + S_{tx,MEV}$. However, we
can assume that Bob will take some period of time, $\delta$ after Alice
produces her block to produce a workObject that is greater than Alice's as well
as produce a block which meets the intrinsic block entropy threshold.

That means that for the time $\delta$ Bob is additionally competing against the
honest network hashrate $\gamma * (1-\beta)$ where gamma is the total network
hashrate and Bob's hashrate being the dishonest party is $\beta$.  This means
that we can quantify Bob's disadvantage in producing a chain with greater
entropy with his perferred transaction ording he would need to have greater
than 50% of the network hashrate, or would need to achieve a "lucky" result
that is outside the expectation value.

Moreover, after Bob produces his block $n$, if he decided to continue mining to
try and achieve a win at $n+1$ he would not have any $S_{tx,i}$ to add to the
weight of his next block ensuring that he will lose if the $n+1$ honest block
has any MMTX workObjects included that are not produced directly produced by
Alice.
